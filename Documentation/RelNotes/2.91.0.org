* Magit v2.91.0 Release Notes (unreleased)
** Breaking changes

- ~C-c C-e~ is no longer bound to ~magit-dispatch-popup~.  It is bound
  to  ~magit-edit-thing~ now, so that Forge can add section-specific
  bindings using this key.  ~magit-dispatch-popup~ continues to be
  available on ~h~, ~?~ and ~C-c C-c~.  #3659

- ~C-c C-b~ is no longer bound to ~magit-browse-thing~ to avoid a conflict
  with ~magit-go-backward~ in diff and log buffers.  ~C-c C-w~ (as in web)
  is used instead now.  #3659

** Changes since v2.90.0

- Added ~bug-reference-mode~ to ~git-commit-setup-hook~.  e19e8fb1e

- The "Version" column in ~magit-submodule-list-mode~ and
  ~magit-repolist-mode~ buffers now shows when a repository is dirty.

- Added new command ~magit-log-merged~.  This command requires
  ~git-when-merged~ (https://github.com/mhagger/git-when-merged).  It
  isn't bound in ~magit-log-popup~ by default.  To add it, you can use
  something like

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (magit-define-popup-action 'magit-log-popup
      ?m "Log commit's merge" 'magit-log-merged)
  #+END_SRC

  #3657

- Added new class slot ~keymap~ to allow other packages to define
  section-specific keymaps without naming them ~magit-TYPE-section-map~,
  which would mean using a symbol prefix (~magit-~) that does not match
  the package name.

- Added new option ~magit-diff-refine-ignore-whitespace~, overriding and
  default to the value of ~smerge-refine-ignore-whitespace~.  #3671

- Added new option ~magit-diff-paint-whitespace-lines~, which controls
  in what kind of lines (added/removed/context) whitespace errors are
  highlighted.  #3671

- It is now possible to show whitespace errors only in uncommitted
  changes by setting ~magit-diff-paint-whitespace~ to ~uncommitted~.  The
  obsolete value ~status~ is treated as a synonym.  The intention always
  was to allow limiting to uncommitted changes and limiting to changes
  shown in the status buffer was the closest approximation readily
  available when this feature was first added.  #3671

** Fixes since v2.90.0

- Bumped the minimal required version of ~git-commit~ to the correct
  version.  e9bd33758

- Dropped the new "v" prefix that we started to add to release tags
  starting with the previous release in places where that prefix is
  undesirable.  f441cf6d7

- Staging and unstaging submodules while ~diff.submodule~'s value is ~log~
  broke shortly before the v2.90.0 release.  #3654

- When another window is already displaying the file buffer, then
  ~magit-display-file-buffer-other-window~ did additionally display
  it in the current window.  #3662

- It was undefined whether highlighting of word-granularity
  differences or of whitespace-error had higher priority.  #3671

- The Custom type definition of ~magit-diff-adjust-tab-width~ was
  broken.  #3671

- ~magit-diff-type~ falsely concluded that a diff buffer showed
  unstaged changes when diffing a range where the right side resolves
  to the same commit as ~HEAD~.
